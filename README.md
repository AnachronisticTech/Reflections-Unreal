# The Mirror

## About

The Mirror is a short proof-of-concept cooperative puzzle platform game built in Unreal Engine 4 for the University of Warwick Game Design Society October GameJam on the theme of "reflections". It features a single level with two puzzles designed to introduce a pair of players to the mirror puzzle concept as well as other puzzle features that may be found in future levels should they ever be developed.

This game was developed for a 48-hour GameJam, with only minor updates and bug fixes implemented afterwards. As such, the game should be considered finished since it was intended to be a prototype. Future development is unlikely, but I may revisit the project at a later stage.

## Setup

This game can be built from source using Unreal Engine 4.22.3 or higher by cloning the repository. _Note: I've experienced strange issues with cloned Unreal projects where .uasset files are not loaded properly, meaning the project may not function as intended when built. I am working on finding a fix for this._

Alternatively, prebuilt executables of the game for Windows 64-bit can be found in the Releases tab.

## Controls

This game requires a keyboard/mouse and an XInput gamepad input. For PlayStation 4 controllers on Windows, I recommend using [DS4Windows](https://ryochan7.github.io/ds4windows-site/) to map the controller inputs to those of an Xbox controller.
